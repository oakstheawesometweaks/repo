# WhatAMess
**A simple Messages customization tweak for today's jailbreaks.**

_Designed with iOS 16 in mind, tested on NathanLR on iOS 17._

## Description

For far too long has the Messages app on modern jailbreaks been boring! With WhatAMess, customize (nearly) every color possible across the Messages app. Tailor your app to match your device theme, set your background to what you value most, or just get rid of those green bubbles.

## Features

### General/App-Wide

- Custom Background Image
- Background Image Blur

## Compatability
WhatAMess is compatible with devices running a _rootless_ jailbreak on iOS 16. ***Rootful support coming soon!***
The tweak was also tested on (and has a few specific hooks for) iOS 17, NathanLR, on a 2018 11" iPad Pro. That was the only other "jailbroken" device I had for testing. Technically speaking it should be mostly fine on iOS 17/NathanLR.

Compatability with the following is unknown/uncertain as I don't have the devices to test it but, considering the tweak injects into Messages only, it should be fine. If the tweak works, confirmed, on any of these, _please let me know_:
- Seratonin
- Roothide / Bootstrap
- Palera1n

## Known Issues
The following are issues I hope to address in future versions in the coming months.
Please keep in mind this is my _first tweak_ and I'm still getting familiar with the process. Things may take time. :)
- Replies, their "line" indicators, and their own view is currently broken/unmodified.
- Some text such as "2 Replies" may switch back to the system tint color occasionally on iOS 17.
- "Notify Anyway" text shown after sending a message to another user in DND mode may revert back to system color when leaving and reopening window.
- Link Bubbles in Pinned Message Previews sometimes break, displaying a square instead of a bubble.
- Contact "Info" view on iOS 17 is slightly broken.

## Features I'd Like to Add
- Preset Sharing
- Custom Large Title
- Redesigned Conversation Cells
- Better User Images + Name at Top of Chat View
- Your Suggestions!

## Who Am I Anyways?
Hey! I'm OaksTheAwesome, Oak shorthand. 

First thing's first, I'm no developer by any means. I took some extremely basic python, HTML, and java in highschool, and a singular python class in college. I'm relatively familiar with Java, but Obj-C was only something I stabbed at recently.

Full time college student, part time job, busy life and all the typical things. I primarily focus on my YouTube channel in my creative efforts, that being commentary with a gaming/VR focus. I take on the occasional random project like this when I feel like it. :)

I got interested in jailbreaking back on iOS 11 with my 6th Gen iPod Touch. I've used a jailbroken iDevice almost every day since. After losing my XS on 14.6, I missed the messages customization tweaks of old. So, instead of waiting around for some update or someone to release one, I just attempted to make one myself. Roughly 9 months later and here I am. I hope you enjoy this little thing of mine!
