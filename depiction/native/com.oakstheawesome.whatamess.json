With WhatAMess, customize (nearly) every color possible across the Messages app. Tailor your app to match your device theme, set your background to what you value most, or just get rid of those green bubbles.\n\n## Features\n\n### General/App-Wide\n- Change App-Wide Tint Color\n- Modern NavBar: A navigation bar that blurs content closer to the top of the screen. (Inspired by Messages on iOS 26. Togglable)\n- Stock NavBar Tinting\n- Cell Tinting\n\n### Conversation List View\n- Custom Background Color (Pinned and Cells separately)\n- Custom Background Image\n- Background Image Blur\n- Custom Conversation Title, Preview, and Time/Date Color\n- Pinned Conversation Preview Bubble + Text Color\n- Custom NavBar Title String + Color\n- Hide Separators\n- Hide Search Background\n- Hide Pinned Conversation Glow\n\n### Chat View\n- Custom Background Color\n- Custom Background Image\n- Background Image Blur\n- Custom SMS, iMessage, and Recieved Bubble Colors\n- Custom SMS, iMessage, and Recieved Bubble Text Colors\n- Custom Timestamp Colors\n- Modern Message Bar: A similar principle to Modern NavBar. Creates a blur behind the message bar that blurs content closer to the bottom of the screen.\n- Stock Message Bar Tint Color\n- Message Input Field Background Color\n- Message Input Field Background Blur\n- Message Input Field Placeholder Text + Text Color\n- Input Text Color\n- Camera/App Drawer Tint\n- Link Bubble Background + Text Color\n\n## Compatability\nWhatAMess is compatible with devices running a _rootless_ jailbreak on iOS 16. ***Rootful support coming soon!***\nThe tweak was also tested on (and has a few specific hooks for) iOS 17, NathanLR, on a 2018 11\" iPad Pro. That was the only other \"jailbroken\" device I had for testing. Technically speaking it should be mostly fine on iOS 17/NathanLR.\n\nCompatability with the following is unknown/uncertain as I don't have the devices to test it but, considering the tweak injects into Messages only, it should be fine. If the tweak works, confirmed, on any of these, _please let me know_:\n- Seratonin\n- Roothide / Bootstrap\n- Palera1n\n\n## Known Issues\nThe following are issues I hope to address in future versions in the coming months.\nPlease keep in mind this is my _first tweak_ and I'm still getting familiar with the process. Things may take time. :)\n- Replies, their \"line\" indicators, and their own view is currently broken/unmodified.\n- Some text such as \"2 Replies\" may switch back to the system tint color occasionally on iOS 17.\n- \"Notify Anyway\" text shown after sending a message to another user in DND mode may revert back to system color when leaving and reopening window.\n- Link Bubbles in Pinned Message Previews sometimes break, displaying a square instead of a bubble.\n- Contact \"Info\" view on iOS 17 is slightly broken.\n\n## Features I'd Like to Add\n- Preset Sharing\n- Custom Large Title\n- Redesigned Conversation Cells\n- Better User Images + Name at Top of Chat View\n- Your Suggestions!\n\n## Who Am I Anyways?\nHey! I'm OaksTheAwesome, Oak shorthand. \n\nFirst thing's first, I'm no developer by any means. I took some extremely basic python, HTML, and java in highschool, and a singular python class in college. I'm relatively familiar with Java, but Obj-C was only something I stabbed at recently.\n\nFull time college student, part time job, busy life and all the typical things. I primarily focus on my YouTube channel in my creative efforts, that being commentary with a gaming/VR focus. I take on the occasional random project like this when I feel like it. :)\n\nI got interested in jailbreaking back on iOS 11 with my 6th Gen iPod Touch. I've used a jailbroken iDevice almost every day since. After losing my XS on 14.6, I missed the messages customization tweaks of old. So, instead of waiting around for some update or someone to release one, I just attempted to make one myself. Roughly 9 months later and here I am. I hope you enjoy this little thing of mine!\n\n## Questions? Bugs?
